# BAGS-Shiny: a web-based interactive tool for exploring the Baltic Sea microbial gene set

BAGS-Shiny is a RShiny application that was developed to enable interactive exploration of the Baltic Sea Gene Set (BAGS v1.1), which comprises 66.53 million functionally and taxonomically annotated genes.

BAGS-Shiny allows users to perform searches by sequence similarity (BLAST) and/or taxonomic and functional annotation.
The results from BLAST searches can be linked to the functional annotation and taxonomic affiliation of the target representative gene, as well as the geographic location of the Baltic Sea samples where these genes were assembled from. Additionally, access to KEGG modules and pathways is provided for each selected representative gene if the gene has a corresponding KO (KEGG) number.

It is worth highlighting that the same RShiny app code can be used to develop applications tailored for other gene catalogues.
